# Python-Proj
Started working on these on 23 or 24 sept :)
This repository stores all the python projects I've managed to complete on my own and by help of freecodecamp. Major ones being certification projects: Time Calculator, Budget App and Arithmatic Formatter.
While I like Dijkstra's algorithm, merge-sort and cipher quite a bit with lots of love for the other projects too.
